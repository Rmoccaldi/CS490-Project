# CS490-Project

Create the WAR card game
  
  The user can compete against an automated computer or against another user. 
  The cards will lay face down, flip over, and the user with the highest card value wins.
  Tie breakers will lay an additional 2 cards next to one another, lay another 4th card that will then flip over. The highest value 4th       card will take the win. If the 4th card values are the same, the process will repeat- 2 additional cards then a 7th card laid.
  The user who collects all 52 cards first, wins the game. 
  Cards will fly in from each side face down before flipping over at the same time.
  There will be a pile on each bottom corner to show the user's card pile. There will be a card count next to that card pile which shows     how many cards each user has at any given time.
